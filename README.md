## 1. PROJECT DESCRIPTION
| Topic | Details |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| What is Hangman | Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts. |
| What it does | This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it. |
| The aim of the project | To write a program in Python for the user to be able to enter a character at a time and be able to get the right output for being able to play the Hangman game. If the user's character is in the word the computer has chosen at random, the user gets to continue. If the users enters the incorrect character their life is deducted. The user gets 5 lives. |
| What I learnt   | Basic and advanced Python coding, CLI|
|                 | Git, GitHub, Markdown |
|                 | Defining & calling functions, string validation, __self__, importing libraries
